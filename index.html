            <p>
                The purpose of this study proposal is to examine the factors that lead to exam-cheating behavior among
                students as well as the potential efficacy of Safe Exam Browser in doing so. It will examine the
                applicability and significance of the study, the aim of the research plan, and the summary, conclusions,
                and suggestions. The study results could be used by educational institutions to create strategies and
                policies to discourage exam-taking fraud and support student academic integrity. Previous studies have
                demonstrated that students cheat for a variety of causes, including the pressure to perform well, a lack
                of planning, and the belief that cheating is okay. Many strategies, including proctors, invigilators,
                and monitoring tools, have been used to stop cheating. <br> An open-source web browser called Safe Exam
                Browser was created to stop cheating on online tests. This review will look at how frequently students
                cheat on exams, what influences student cheating, why students cheat, and how well safeguards like the
                safe test browser work. Additionally, it will examine how technology is used, how lecturers and students
                view the use of secure test browsers, and the various forms of cheating behavior, including collusion,
                plagiarism, and cheating on exams. </p>

            <h2 class="project">Abstract</h2>
            <p>Cheating during examinations is a pervasive problem in educational institutions. It is important to
                understand the reasons why students cheat and develop strategies to minimize cheating.
                The issue of student cheating during examinations has become a major concern in the academic world, and
                this has called for the need to explore possible measures to curb the menace.(1) GÃ¶tz, M., & Frenzel, A.
                C. (2017) . One such measure is the use of a safe exam browser, which has been found to be an effective
                tool for minimizing cheating during examinations. This research proposal seeks to investigate the
                effectiveness of a safe exam browser in curbing student cheating during examinations. The research will
                explore the relevance and importance of the research, the purpose of the research proposal, the summary
                and conclusions, and recommendations. A safe exam browser is a secure browser designed to prevent
                cheating during online exams. It works by preventing students from accessing unauthorized websites,
                applications, and files while taking an online exam. It also provides a secure environment for storing
                and submitting exam answers. (ii) Safe Exam Browser. (2021). Retrieved from https://safeexambrowser.org/
                Watson, S. The research will assess the effectiveness of the Safe Exam Browser in minimizing cheating
                during examinations.

                    <p>SEB runs on a local computer and it is connected via the internet to a learning management system
                        (LMS) or an e-assessment system. Generally SEB works with any web based LMS and other kinds of
                        web
                        based exam systems. Some learning management systems (LMS) like for example Moodle, ILIAS,
                        OpenOlat
                        and exam solutions as Inspera Assessment offer a quiz mode specifically compatible with SEB.
                    </p>
                    <p>SEB does not connect to any central server or cloud service! SEB Server is being developed as an
                        independent open source software component that can be installed on a self-operated server. SEB
                        clients can then be connected to such an SEB server instance using individual configuration
                        files. This is strictly optional and must be configured individually in any case. This also
                        applies to the support and proctoring capabilities in new SEB versions via video conferencing
                        services such as Jitsi Meet (open source, can be installed on a self-operated server) or Zoom
                        (commercial, cloud-based). This video conferencing connection must also be configured
                        individually and is always disabled by default. If an SEB client has been configured to connect
                        to a video conferencing service or an SEB server instance, this will be indicated to candidates
                        when starting an exam session and video/audio proctoring/support must be explicitly agreed to by
                        each exam candidate in a dialog box.

                        assessment. Ultimately, the effectiveness of online graduate tests will depend on how well they
                        are designed and administered, as well as on the individual needs and circumstances of each

                    <p>In this video, I'll show you how to download and setup a browser (called SafeExamBrowser) which
                        prevents users to shift between websites and windows, which is useful during online exams.
                        <br> To log in to the demo exams in Moodle, use one of the demo users "seb1" - "seb10", with the
                        password "demo". <br> In case you need to quit SEB without submitting the exam (then a red quit
                        SEB
                        link is displayed), the quit password in these demo exam settings is "quit" (use the quit
                        button)
                        on the right bottom or the key shortcuts cmd - Q on Mac or ctrl - Q on Windows.

                    <p>You just need to first download SEB for your platform and install it (Windows) or open (double
                        click) the SafeExamBrowser-...dmg (Disk Image) file and drag the Safe Exam Browser icon onto the
                        Applications folder. On iOS, use the link to the App Store. <br>
