            <h2 class="project" id="introduction">Introduction:</h2>
            <p>Student cheating during examinations has been a long-standing issue in the academic world,
                with several studies pointing to the prevalence of the problem. This problem has been attributed to
                various factors, such as the pressure to perform well, lack of preparation, and the availability of
                technology. One effective solution that has been suggested is the use of safe exam browser, which is a
                software that limits access to the internet and other applications during an examination.
                <br> Cheating can take many forms, including plagiarism, copying from other students, using unauthorized
                materials, and using electronic devices. Cheating undermines the integrity of education and devalues
                academic achievements. Many institutions have implemented measures to prevent cheating, but there is
                still a need to explore new methods to minimize cheating during examinations. One promising approach is
                the use of Safe Exam Browser, which restricts access to the internet and other computer applications
                during examinations.
                This research
                proposal seeks to investigate the effectiveness of safe exam browser in minimizing student cheating
                during examinations.
            </p>
            <h2 class="project" id="objective">Objectives:</h2>
            <p>The objectives of this research are to:</p>

            <h2 class="project" id="hypothesis">Hypothesis:</h2>
            <p>H1: There is a significant relationship between the use of SEB and reducing cheating during exams.
                <br>H2: Students' perceptions of SEB positively influence the effectiveness of the application in
                reducing cheating during exams. <br>H3: The use of SEB during examinations will significantly reduce the
                incidence of academic cheating among students.
            </p>

            <h2 class="project" id="methodology">Methodology:</h2>
            <p>This research proposal will employ a mixed-method approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative
                methods. A survey will be administered to students to collect quantitative data on cheating behavior and
                student engagement. In addition, qualitative data will be collected through focus group discussions with
                students and faculty members. The research will be conducted at a university of Lays Advantists of
                Kigali (UNILAK), Kigali campus. The
                study will be conducted during the fall semester of 2023, and the sample size will be determined using a
                random sampling technique.
                <br> This research will adopt a mixed-method approach, which involves both quantitative and qualitative
                data
                collection and analysis. The research will involve a survey of students and lecturers to collect data on
                the prevalence of student cheating, the effectiveness of safe exam browser, and the factors that
                influence student cheating.
                <br>The study will also utilize a mixed-method approach, incorporating a questionnaire survey and
                semi-structured interviews. The questionnaire survey will be administered to a sample of students,
                randomly selected from the university's population. The semi-structured interviews will be conducted
                with students, lecturers, and invigilators to explore their experiences with cheating during exams and
                the effectiveness of SEB. Additionally, interviews and focus group discussions will be conducted to
                explore the perceptions of students and lecturers towards the use of safe exam browser.
                Data will be analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, and the
                findings will be presented in tables, graphs, and charts, content analysis, and thematic analysis.

            <h2 class="project" id="literature">Literature Review:</h2>
            <p>Previous research on cheating during examinations has shown that the problem is prevalent in educational
                institutions. Studies have shown that students cheat due to various reasons, such as pressure to perform
                well, lack of preparation, and the perception that cheating is acceptable. Various methods have been
                employed to combat cheating, including proctors, invigilators, and monitoring software. However, these
                methods have limitations, and students still find ways to cheat. Safe Exam Browser is an open-source web
                browser designed to prevent cheating during online exams. Studies have shown that Safe Exam Browser is
                effective in preventing cheating during online exams.<br>On the prevalence of student cheating during
                examinations, the factors that influence student cheating, reasons behind student cheating during
                examinations and the effectiveness of measures such as
                safe exam browser in minimizing student cheating. The review will also examine the use of
                technology, in preventing cheating during examinations. The review will also explore the perceptions of
                students and lecturers towards the use of safe exam browser. The review will be based on peer-reviewed
                articles, books, and other relevant sources.
