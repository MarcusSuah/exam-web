            <h2 class="project" id="abstract">Abstract:</h2>
            <p>Cheating during examinations is a pervasive problem in educational institutions. It is important to
                understand the reasons why students cheat and develop strategies to minimize cheating.
                The issue of student cheating during examinations has become a major concern in the academic world, and
                this has called for the need to explore possible measures to curb the menace.(1) Götz, M., & Frenzel, A.
                C. (2017) . One such measure is the use of a safe exam browser, which has been found to be an effective
                tool for minimizing
                cheating during examinations. This research proposal seeks to investigate the effectiveness of a safe
                exam browser in curbing student cheating during examinations. The research will explore the relevance
                and importance of the research, the purpose of the research proposal, the summary and conclusions, and
                recommendations. A safe exam browser is a secure browser designed to prevent cheating during online
                exams. It works by preventing students from accessing unauthorized websites, applications, and files
                while taking an online exam. It also provides a secure environment for storing and submitting exam
                answers. (ii) Safe Exam Browser. (2021). Retrieved from https://safeexambrowser.org/ Watson, S. The
                research will assess the effectiveness of the Safe Exam Browser in minimizing cheating during
                examinations.

            <h2 class="project" id="introduction">Introduction:</h2>
            <p>This project proposal seeks to investigate why students cheat during examinations and how the safe Exam
                Browser online platform can be used to eliminate cheating. Student cheating during examinations has been
                a long-standing issue in the academic world, with several studies pointing to the prevalence of the
                problem. This problem has been attributed to various factors, such as the pressure to perform well, lack
                of preparation, and the availability of technology. One effective solution that has been suggested is
                the use of a safe exam browser, which is software that limits access to the internet and other
                applications during an examination. Cheating can take many forms, including plagiarism, copying from
                other students, using unauthorized materials, and using electronic devices. Cheating undermines the
                integrity of education and devalues academic achievements. Many institutions have implemented measures
                to prevent cheating, but there is still a need to explore new methods to minimize cheating during
                examinations. One promising approach is the use of Safe Exam Browser, which restricts access to the
                internet and other computer applications during examinations. The project will also include a discussion
                of the objectives, hypothesis, and methodology used, as well as a conclusion and references. Appendices
                will provide additional information and a bibliography will be provided for further reading. This
                research proposal also seeks to investigate the effectiveness of a safe exam browser in minimizing
                student cheating during examinations.

            </p>

            <h2 class="project" id="literature">Literature Review:</h2>
            <p> Previous research on cheating during examinations has shown that the problem is prevalent in educational
                institutions. Studies have shown that students cheat due to various reasons, such as pressure to perform
                well, lack of preparation, and the perception that cheating is acceptable. Various methods have been
                employed to combat cheating, including proctors, invigilators, and monitoring software. However, these
                methods have limitations, and students still find ways to cheat. Safe Exam Browser is an open-source web
                browser designed to prevent cheating during online exams. Studies have shown that Safe Exam Browser is
                effective in preventing cheating during online exams. <br>
                On the prevalence of student cheating during examinations, the factors that influence student cheating,
                the reasons behind student cheating during examinations, and the effectiveness of measures such as safe
                exam browsers in minimizing student cheating. The review will also examine the use of technology, in
                preventing cheating during examinations. The review will also explore the perceptions of students and
                lecturers toward the use of safe exam browsers. The review will be based on peer-reviewed articles,
                books, and other relevant sources.
                It will explore the different types of cheating behaviors, such as plagiarism, cheating during exams,
                and collusion. The review will also examine the different methods that have been developed to prevent
                academic cheating, including technology-based solutions such as SEB.

            </p>

            <h2 class="project" id="objective">About:</h2>
            <p>Safe exam browser is a program that provides a secure environment for taking online exams. SEB is a web
                browser specifically designed to create a secure environment for taking online exams. It is intended to
                prevent cheating and protect the validity of the exam process. During the exam, SEB locks down the
                system, stopping the student from accessing other applications or websites. SEB also has features that
                enable teachers to observe student behavior and identify any attempts to cheat. This can help guarantee
                that exams are conducted fairly and that students take responsibility for their actions. SEB runs on a
                local computer and it is connected via the internet to a learning management system (LMS) or an
                e-assessment system. Generally, SEB works with any web-based LMS and other kinds of web-based exam
                systems. Some learning management systems (LMS) for example Model, ILIAS, OpenOlat, and exam solutions
                such as Inspera Assessment offer a quiz mode specifically compatible with SEB. SEB does not connect to
                any central server or cloud service! SEB Server is being developed as an independent open-source
                software component that can be installed on a self-operated server. SEB clients can then be connected to
                such a SEB server instance using individual configuration files. This is strictly optional and must be
                configured individually in any case. This also applies to the support and proctoring capabilities in new
                SEB versions via video conferencing services such as Jitsi Meet (open source, can be installed on a
                self-operated server) or Zoom (commercial, cloud-based). This video conferencing connection must also be
                configured individually and is always disabled by default. If a SEB client has been configured to
                connect to a video conferencing service or a SEB server instance, this will be indicated to candidates
                when starting an exam session and video/audio proctoring/support must be explicitly agreed to by each
                exam candidate in a dialog box.
            </p>

            <h2 class="project" id="objective">Benefit of SEB:</h2>
            <p>SEB can help to reduce cheating in the classroom by providing a secure environment for taking exams. It
                also allows teachers to monitor student activity and detect any attempts at cheating. This can help to
                ensure that exams are fair and that students are held accountable for their actions.
                SEB also helps to promote academic integrity and encourages students to take their studies seriously. It
                can also help to create an environment of trust and respect between teachers and students, which can
                lead to better learning outcomes.
            </p>
            <h2 class="project" id="objective">Limitation of SEB:</h2>
            <p>While SEB can help to reduce cheating in the classroom, it has limitations. It can be difficult to
                configure and may require additional hardware and software to be installed. It also requires a certain
                level of technical expertise to set up and use.
                SEB can also be bypassed by tech-savvy students, and it may not be able to detect all attempts at
                cheating. As such, it is important to have other measures in place to ensure the integrity of the exam
                process.
            </p>
            <h2 class="project" id="objective">Objectives:</h2>
            <p>The objectives of this research are to:</p>

                materials, and other costs for data collection, data analysis, and report writing. The estimated budget
                for the research is $10,000.</p>
            <h2 class="project" id="timeline">Recommendations:</h2>
            <p>Eliminating cheating requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the underlying issues and provides
                support to students. By creating a culture of academic integrity and providing resources to help
                students succeed, schools can help prevent cheating and promote academic excellence.</p>
            <p> Create a culture of academic integrity: Schools should emphasize the importance of academic integrity
                and create a culture where cheating is not tolerated.</p>
            <p> Educate students on the consequences of cheating: Students should be informed of the consequences of
                cheating, both academically and professionally.</p>
            <p> Encourage time management skills: Schools should provide resources and support to help students manage
                their time effectively.</p>
            <p> Provide academic support: Schools should provide resources for students who are struggling with the
                material. This can include tutoring, study groups, and academic counseling.</p>
            <p> Use technology to prevent cheating: Schools can use technology to detect and prevent cheating. This can
                include plagiarism detection software and online proctoring for exams.</p>
            <p> That 60% of academic evaluations be done online while the remaining 40% of the evaluation be done face
                to face. This will eliminate the tendency to cheat during exams.</p>

            <h2 class="project" id="timeline">Appendix:</h2>
            <p>Appendix A: Pressure to Perform: One of the main reasons why students cheat is the pressure to perform.
                There is a lot of emphasis on grades, and students feel that they need to do well in order to succeed in
                their academic and professional careers. <br>
                i. Lack of Understanding: Sometimes, students cheat because they do not understand the material. They
                feel that cheating is the only way to pass the exam or complete the assignment.
                <br> ii. Laziness: Some students cheat simply because they are lazy. They do not want to put in the
                effort to study or complete assignments, so they take shortcuts.
                <br> iii. Lack of Consequences: If students do not face any consequences for cheating, they are more
                likely to continue cheating. This can happen if teachers do not take cheating seriously or if the
                penalties for cheating are not severe enough.
                <br> iv. Peer Pressure: Students may also cheat because of peer pressure. They may feel that they need
                to cheat in order to fit in with their friends or because their friends are also cheating.

            </p>
